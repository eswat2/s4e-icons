# s4e-icons

A simple component library for Svelte which provides a small number of simple Icon components based on SVG's from Material Design Icons:

- ChevronDoubleLeft
- Close
- Fingerprint
- Paw
- Radio - _this has a selected property_
- Refresh

All of these are purely for exploratory work with respect to learning how Svelte components can be packaged and shared.
